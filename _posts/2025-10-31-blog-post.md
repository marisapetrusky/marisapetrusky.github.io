I was honored to speak on the Engineering Graduate School Panel at the 2025 Physics and Astronomy Congress in Denver, Colorado, hosted by AIP and the Society of Physics Students/Sigma Pi Sigma Honor Society (SPS)! I would not be where I am today without my alma mater's local SPS chapter, and it's always a privledge to give back and de-mystify the not-so-hard journey from Physics to Engineering!
