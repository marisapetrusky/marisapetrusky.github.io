I was honored to give the tutorial talk at APS DPP 2025 Student Day, titled "Plasma Physics: From A-Z". The event is designed for undergraduate and graduate students to familiarize themselves with the types of research they should expect to see at the conference. My tutorial talk covered terminology found in general plasma physics, experimental and computational plasma physics, fusion, low temperature plasmas, and astrophysical plasmas!
