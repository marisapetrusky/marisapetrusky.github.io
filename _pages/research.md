My research interests lie at the intersection of fundamental plasma physics and high-speed compressible flow analysis. 

# Atmospheric Entry Flows

Arguably, the most dangerous part of any planetary exploration mission is the entry of a spacecraft through a planetâ€™s atmosphere. Spacecraft must rapidly decelerate from entry velocities upwards of 40 times the speed of sound, resulting in the compression and heating of gas via a hypersonic shock layer. Accurate numerical simulations of this intense flow regime are essential for designing safe and optimized spacecraft, particularly when delicate instrumentation and astronauts are inside.

At sufficiently high entry speeds, a fraction of gas is ionized via the shock layer to form a plasma. These ionized species carry electric charge, leading to the formation of electric fields. Conventionally, plasma electrostatics are neglected in entry flow simulations, as calculation of electric fields can be prohibitively computationally expensive. Advances in computing technology have lessened this limitation, and several studies have shown differences in key parameters of interest when accounting for plasma electrostatics in select entry flight regimes: most notably, increased vehicle surface heat flux. However, more general guidelines on the altitudes and vehicle speeds where plasma electrostatics matter most have yet to be established in literature, thereby preventing a majority of computationalists from accounting for this crucial phenomena. 

The primary focus of my thesis research is in building a stronger, more fundamental understanding of how plasma electrostatics impact a hypersonic shock layer. Using a one-dimensional version of the problem, I can efficiently simulate hypersonic plasma electrostatics independent of vehicle geometry for a range of altitudes and vehicle speeds. Collectively, this research will help define benchmarks which can determine the relevancy of electrostatic calculations for a particular entry flowfield.
