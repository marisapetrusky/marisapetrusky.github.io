I am a fifth year PhD Candidate at University of Colorado Boulder and a member of the [Nonequilibrium Gas and Plasma Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/ngpdl), advised by Dr. Iain D. Boyd. I broadly specialize in kinetic modeling of rarefied gases and plasmas. I am especially interested in advancing simulation techniques for studying electrostatics in hypersonic flows. 

I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor's in Physics. There, I discovered my love of plasma physics with the [Plasma Accelerator Group](https://you.stonybrook.edu/plasmaaccelerators/). I completed an undergraduate research thesis on simulation of electron probe diagnostics for laser-induced plasma wakefield accelerators, advised by Dr. Navid Vafaei-Najafabadi.

Throughout my career, I have participated in, volunteered for, and organized mentoring programs and STEM retention initiatives. I love giving back to the community and helping others find their paths in STEM!
